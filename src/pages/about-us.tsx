          Raised in the United States, founding president and master designer, Benjamin Javaheri literally grew up in the trade. It seems to have been carved in his destiny to be in the industry because â€œjavaheri" means jewelry in Farsi language. He started Uneek Jewelry in 1997, a major step that allowed him to provide design and manufacturing services to several brands. His designs are now being sold worldwide --- Australia, Canada, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea --- with more countries to conquer soon.

          <p>
          Looking back to his humble beginnings, Benjamin recalls, <em>&quot;I was the light behind the industry stars. I was the designer who brought their concepts and visions to life.&quot;</em>
          </p>
          <p>
          For Benjamin, it all begins with the stones. <em>&quot;A beautiful diamond is like a treasured work of art. It requires the perfect frame to enhance and protect its beauty and value.&quot;</em>
